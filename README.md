# Wine Quality Analysis

This repository contains solutions for **Assignment 1** in the course **IDATG2208 - Introduction to Machine Learning**.  
The task focuses on predicting wine quality using the **Wine Quality Dataset** (red variants of Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine).  

The assignment includes:  
- Data exploration and correlation analysis  
- Simple and multiple linear regression (with gradient descent)  
- Model evaluation using MSE, RMSE, and RÂ²  
- Regularization (Ridge, Lasso)  
- Comparison with non-linear models (Decision Tree, Random Forest)  

Figures, code snippets, and evaluation results are included as part of the analysis.
